**Problem Description:**
A description of the client scenario that you are modeling describing it in sufficient detail that
makes sense in the context of your data model. This should be reflective of your conversation
with your client.
**Our response:** 
In our interactions with our client (Atlanta Braves Management), we have decided to make a comprehensive system to manage the teams operations using a relational database model in SQL. In this model, we created many entities that break down the structure of the Atlanta Braves organization. As seen in our model, we have highlighted many key sectors of our client's organizations that require the most focus. For the Atlanta Braves’ organization to be successful and optimize its efficiency and profitability, the management team needs to use these highlighted components to make the right decisions. 

By using our relational database on your baseball operations, our client will be able to see a 360-degree view of the team’s current operations and use that to assess your current strengths and weaknesses. From this assessment, the Braves’ management team will be able to derive key insights and metrics on aspects of their business that they otherwise might have been unaware of. Utilizing this, we are sure that they will make key changes that will thrust the company in the right direction.

Our model and analysis were created to ensure proper integration of all aspects of team management. Due to the dynamic nature of the MLB and the Atlanta Braves position in it, this breakdown of our client’s structure will highlight the organization’s operational needs and allow the company to gain a competitive advantage amongst other teams.
